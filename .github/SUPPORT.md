# STOP #

If you are debugging a failed build or have a question about GitHub Actions in
general do **NOT** open an issue here. Either post on the Actions sections of
the [GitHub Community](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/bd-p/actions)
or the [RStudio
Community](https://community.rstudio.com/new-topic?category=Package%20development&tags=github-actions)
forums.

Open an issue here _only_ if you have a feature request or bug in one of the
custom R specific actions themselves.
